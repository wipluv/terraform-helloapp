they say a man must need protection
they say every man must fall
yet i swear i see my reflection 
some place so high above the wall
i see my light come shining 
from the west unto the east
any day now, any day now
i shall be released
down here next to me in this lonely crowd
is a man who swears he's not to blame
all day long i hear him cry so loud
calling out the he's been framed
i see my lihjt comes shining from the west unto the east 
any day now, any day now
i shhal be released...
